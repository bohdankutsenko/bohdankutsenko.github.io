I am an experienced and results-driven software engineer with a strong background in full-stack development and artificial intelligence/machine learning. Adept at developing robust and scalable applications while leveraging AI/ML techniques to drive innovative solutions. Proven track record of leading successful projects and collaborating in cross-functional teams.

Professional experience building a bunch of awesome products right from scratch covering various domains like fin-tech, e-commerce, mergers-acquisition, edu-tech, media, community portals, etc. ranging from early stage startup to well established organizations.

I enjoy learning new skills and implementing them in real life!
