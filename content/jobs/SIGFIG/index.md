- I’ve done many UI feature development that I think are really applauded by my managers and colleagues. But there’s one that I think I’m really proud of is the refactoring of a very complex/large container that contained 2k lines of code and I cut it down to 600 lines. It improved developer experience a lot like it was so much easier to integrate/implement any new feature and get that working within minutes.
- Developed tons of components in ReactJS hooks and TypeScript with apollo-client as an interface to talk to server using GraphQl queries. All the components were covered with their own unit/component test case using react-testing-library.
- There was not even a single piece of text that was hard-coded or we can say, no static text. All of that we pull in from the CMS, content-stack using GraphQL queries for each and every text on the application. This was just to make sure that every partner can customize according to their needs right from the content-stack User Interface instead of digging inside the code.
- Utilized the well-known tech, Storybook, to develop all the Core repository components in an isolated manner that covers all the state of the component regardless of how it works inside the application and we can easily play around with them on the very organized UI that Storybook provides. Really helpful when there’s a huge codebase and we’ve to implement a new feature and for that the small pieces like buttons, cards, etc. are pre-built and we just have to now plug-n-play.
